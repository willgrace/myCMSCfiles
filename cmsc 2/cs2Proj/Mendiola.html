    The desire for information is too rampant today. Connection is a number one factor to deliver different information needed by everyone. Technology made connection fast, efficient and effective.  Now, our big world was made small because of this new type of technology introduced to improve connectivity and deliver or share different information whenever and wherever you are. Live feed is here to use and promote this technology. Feeding information using different technological means like using phone and computers has now become a worldly trend. This site will satisfy, not only the hunger for information, but also to connect our lives and widen our circle of friends  by improving connectivity.  We're here to quench that thirst for knowledge.<br /><br />


	So if you want knowledge and information, you're in the right place. Let's keep in touch folks!<br />

                   <h6>The people behind this project are these three "non-human" thingy.</h6><br /><br />
                   
                    It's amazing to see how small a place is, and yet not knowing all the people in it. The crazy minds behind this crazy site are these three alie...err...humans. They are all in their second year in a well-known university in Los Banos, Laguna, Phil. Actually, they rarely talked to each other, or should I say never talked to each other until the end of their semester – when the grouping for a certain project is starting.  Their roads crossed and friendship bloomed among them. Though some of them have different field of course, they remained intact and cooperative. <br /><br />
                    
While making their project, they had a big problem, conflicts in their schedules. They all have different and important things to do and it seems that they cannot have at least one decent group meeting. So, these three came with the idea of interacting using different technological means possible – chat , text messaging, e-mail, and many more ways. Fortunately, this idea was not wasted and it became a great help for managing their busy schedules. From there, they decided to make connectivity as their topic for the said project, and that is LIVE FEED!<br /><br />

                            Rikki Lee Mendiola<br /><br />
                            
                            Ako si Rikki Lee Mendiola, BS Development Communication student sa UPLB, batch 2009, mahilig magsulat ng kung anu-ano, mahilig uminom ng kape at walang bisyo kundi magmahal.<br /><br />

Kung iniisip mong lalaki ako, nagkakamali ka.<br /><br />

Hindi ako lalaki, babae ako. Nung bata pa ako, lagi akong nilalagay sa heat ng lalaki tuwing swimming meet. Nung high school, ang nakalagay sa transcript of records ko ay 'male,' nung graduating na ako tsaka ko lang nalaman na malaking problema ang pagkakamali sa gender sa aking TOR. Nung first year college ako, tinanong ng teacher ko sa econ11 kung 'babae ba to o lalake?' nung nagtop ako sa exam niya. At ngayong second year, paboritong banggitin ng mga professor ko sa devcom subjects ang pangalan ko. Sa dami dami nang nanghuhula sa pinaggalingan ng aking pangalan, dalawa pa lang ang nakakatama. Kung iniisip mo ay yung writer, mali ka. Isang jazz singer ang pinagkuhanan ng pangalan ko, pero hindi ko pa rin kilala ang singer na ito. Malaking misconception ang pangalan ko sa aking pagkatao.<br /><br />

Siguro nga bagay sa akin yung binigay ng magulang ko. Hindi ako 'girly' at karamihan ng barkada ko ay lalaki. Hindi ako mahilig sa shopping, chikahan at mga make up o damit na uso. Pinili ko ang ROTC kesa sa ibang NSTP courses. Hindi ako pihikan. Hindi ako mapili. At higit sa lahat hindi ako maarte.<br />

                            <p>A sleepy, 17-year old ditzy panda who doesn't know what he should be doing in life. Known specialties are:  sleeping, surfing the net, playing online games, reading manga(he loves ecchi. Seriously.), star gazing(that's because he always gets home late), hiking, staying at home staring the wall and many, weird, abnormal pasttimes. He usually lazes off, not even thinking that the world is passing by. He lacks social skills, causing him to become a loner. He’s also prone to emotional breakdowns due to past incidents which crushed him like a submarine sinking into the very deepest part of ocean. His words cause misunderstanding to all the people around him, especially those whom he just met and doesn't know his unusual attitude. Stupid, clumsy, and forgetful even of the current time. Yet he waits the time that he'll find someone, or at least something, that will break him out of that cell and become his true purpose, his true happines, and his true reason to change the boring little world where he lives in.</br></br>

Yep, that is juuuuuuust truly me. I don no masks in life, because that is not my expertise. I may know everything, yet mastered nothing.

                            A certified Anime and Manga Entusiast.
                            The girl of your dreams...in her dreams!<br /><br />
                          WillgraceYohei or Graycel is your stereotypical college student in University of The Philippines, Los Banos, Laguna. She is now in her second year in her course BS Computer Science and currently living inside a Coed Dorm. She is cheerful and fun to be with, and never forgets to wear a smile on her face. She is sensitive and easily-hurt with criticism and knowingly clumsy. She doesn't want to see someone crying because she also doesn't like anyone to see her crying. At first glance, this snobbish looking girl possesses a reserved attitude and kind nature. But behind this timid and sharp façade lies a fragile and sweet girl who is proud of her true being. <br /><br />
                           
                          Known as the 'otaku' of her "3114 sisters", this girl knows a lot about the anime world. Being an only child, Graycel got almost everything that she wanted. Her mother is very supportive to her passion for Anime. She is also seen as a talented girl when it comes to art. She never hides her fondness for anime and art. She expresses herself in the most comfortable way she prefers. She always make sure that other people will see her the way she want it to be.<br /><br />

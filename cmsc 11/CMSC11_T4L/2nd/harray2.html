<center><h1>TWO-DIMENSIONAL ARRAYS</h1></center>
<p>Two-dimensional arrays are a little more complicated to
use than one-dimensional ones. This page presents two methods
of passing a pointer to a two-dimensional array to a function for processing.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="#subscript">first method</a> uses subscript notation inside the function. 
This method has the same disadvantage as in Pascal -- the function
is essentially array specific in that the data types need to match.
However, while in Pascal you need to have a programmer-defined 
double-subscripted type
which is used for both the array and the parameter in the called function,
in C only the second subscript in each needs to match.
A complete <a href="#program1">sample program</a> is provided below.<p></p>
</li><li>The <a href="#offset">second method</a> uses typecasting in the function call 
and a pointer with offsets inside the function. This method permits the
programmer to use the same function to process information in 
arrays with different dimensions.
A complete <a href="#program2">sample program</a> is provided below.<p></p>
</li></ul>

<a name="subscript"></a>
<center><h2>Subscript Notation</h2></center>
<p>Consider an <em>int</em> array as declared below.</p>
<pre>#define NUM_STUDENTS 5
#define NUM_TESTS 4
int grades[NUM_STUDENTS][NUM_TESTS];
</pre>
<ul>
<li>By convention, the first subscript is understood to be for
rows and the second for columns.
</li><li>This array can hold up to 20 integer values, the product
of the values used to declare the array.
</li><li>As is usual in C,
subscripts start with zero, so the subscripts range from 0 to 4
for the rows and 0 to 3 for the columns.
</li><li>If the system uses four bytes for an <em>int</em>, this array
would use 80 bytes of RAM. All of the bytes are in consecutive
memory locations, the first row occupying the first 20 bytes,
the second the next 20, and so on.
</li></ul>
<p>The following table illustrates how the subscripts are specified
for this array, which has five (5) rows and four (4) columns.</p>

<table align="center" border="2" cellpadding="3">
<tbody><tr align="center"> <td><pre>   </pre></td> <td><em>0</em></td> <td><em>1</em></td> <td><em>2</em></td> <td><em>3</em></td> </tr>
<tr align="center"> <td><em>0</em></td> <td>[0][0]</td> <td>[0][1]</td> <td>[0][2]</td> <td>[0][3]</td> </tr>
<tr align="center"> <td><em>1</em></td> <td>[1][0]</td> <td>[1][1]</td> <td>[1][2]</td> <td>[1][3]</td> </tr>
<tr align="center"> <td><em>2</em></td> <td>[2][0]</td> <td>[2][1]</td> <td>[2][2]</td> <td>[2][3]</td> </tr>
<tr align="center"> <td><em>3</em></td> <td>[3][0]</td> <td>[3][1]</td> <td>[3][2]</td> <td>[3][3]</td> </tr>
<tr align="center"> <td><em>4</em></td> <td>[4][0]</td> <td>[4][1]</td> <td>[4][2]</td> <td>[4][3]</td> </tr>

<a name="init"></a>
<h3>Array Initialization: Inline</h3>
<p>To initialize all elements of the <em>grades</em> array to -1 (a number that is
highly improbable for a grade), you could use a nested loop
structure such as the following.</p>
<pre>for( i = 0; i &lt; NUM_STUDENTS; i++)
   for( j = 0; j &lt; NUM_TESTS; j++)
      grades[i][j] = -1;
</pre>
<h3>Array Initialization: At Declaration</h3>
<p>It is also possible to initialize elements of an array
at the time of its declaration. The following declaration
assigns values for three grades for each of the first two
students in the array. Note that the values for a specific row
are enclosed within their own pair of curly brackets.</p>
<pre>   int grades[NUM_STUDENTS][NUM_TESTS] = { {55, 60, 65},
                                           {95, 90, 85} };
</pre>

<p>It may facilitate your programming, if you keep track of
how many elements in the array hold usable values. For this
simple example, we can initialize two variables.</p>
<pre>int num_students = 2;
int num_tests = 3;
</pre>
<h3>Array Processing: Using Subscripts in a Function</h3>
<p>Since, by definition, the name of any array is a pointer, we can
call a function which returns the highest grade in the array
as follows.</p>
<pre>high_test = get_highest( grades, num_students, num_tests);
</pre>
<p>The second and third arguments allow the function to search only
the elements which have been initialized.</p>
<p>One of the ways of writing <em>get_highest()</em> uses subscript
notation:</p>
<pre>int get_highest(int a[][NUM_TESTS], int row, int col)
/* Assumes that there is at least one element */
{
   int i, j;
   int highest = a[0][0];

   for( i = 0; i &lt; row; i++)
      for( j = 0; j &lt; col; j++)
         if ( a[i][j] &gt; highest)
            highest = a[i][j];
   return highest;
}
</pre>
<p>It is necessary in this instance to specify the number of columns 
in the array (the number of items in a row) so that the compiler can
determine the offsets from the beginning of the array. Unlike with the
<a href="http://www.macdonald.egate.net/CompSci/harray1.html#subscript">one-dimensional array algorithm</a>,
where we avoided comparing the first element with itself, here the extra
code required does not outweigh the simplicity of the above algorithm.</p>

<a name="program1"></a>
<h2>Sample Program 1</h2>
<p>This is a complete program which initializes part of an array of integer
grades at the time of its declaration with 6 values and then 
calls a function to find, return, and print the highest grade. Note that
the dimensions of the array have been changed from those used
in the discussion above by altering the compiler directives.</p>
<pre>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

#define NUM_STUDENTS 25
#define NUM_TESTS 10

int get_highest(int a[][NUM_TESTS], int row, int col);

int main()
{
   int grades[NUM_STUDENTS][NUM_TESTS] = { {55, 60, 65},
                                           {85, 90, 95} };
   int num_students = 2;
   int num_tests = 3;
   int high_test;
   
   high_test = get_highest( grades, num_students, num_tests);

   printf("The highest score is %d.\n", high_test);
   return 0;
}

int get_highest(int a[][NUM_TESTS], int row, int col)
/* Assumes that there is at least one element */
{
   int i, j;
   int highest = a[0][0];

   for( i = 0; i &lt; row; i++)
      for( j = 0; j &lt; col; j++)
         if ( a[i][j] &gt; highest)
            highest = a[i][j];
   return highest;
}
</pre>

<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a>
<a name="offset"></a>
</p><center><h2>Pointer Notation with Offset</h2></center>
<p>Consider the <em>int</em> array as declared below. It is the same as
the one discussed above except for the slight modification of the
identifiers. This change was made so that we can have a second array
which will be declared with different dimensions.</p>
<pre>#define NUM_STUDENTS1 5
#define NUM_TESTS1 4
int grades1[NUM_STUDENTS1][NUM_TESTS1];
</pre>
<p>The following table illustrates the offsets of the elements from the
start of this array, 
which has five (5) rows and four (4) columns.
 The italicized numbers are 
the subscripts for the rows and columns.</p>

<table align="center" border="2" cellpadding="3">
<tbody><tr align="center"> <td><pre>   </pre></td> <td><em>0</em></td> <td><em>1</em></td> <td><em>2</em></td> <td><em>3</em></td> </tr>

<h3>Array Initialization: Inline</h3>
<p>To initialize all elements of the <em>grades1</em> array to -1 (a number that is
highly improbable for a grade), you could use a nested loop
structure as was done <a href="#init">above</a> or do a cheat such as the 
following.</p>
<pre>for( i = 0; i &lt; NUM_STUDENTS1 * NUM_TESTS1; i++)
      *((int *)grades1 + i) = -1;
</pre>
<p>This method takes advantage of the fact that <em>grades1</em>
is a pointer constant for a two-dimensional array. It uses the
loop control variable as the offset from the beginning of the array.
The casting of the pointer constant fools the compiler into thinking
that the array is one-dimensional. Since both our two-dimensional 
<em>grade1</em> array and a one-dimensional array 
capable of holding 20 <em>int</em>s would be stored using a total of 80 
consecutive bytes of RAM, no harm is done by this trickery.</p>

<h3>Array Initialization: Generalized Using a Function</h3>
<p>However, since the code above is array specific, we may want to generalize
by creating a function which will initialize any two-dimensional array
of <em>int</em>s.</p>
<pre>void init_int_array(int *a, int num_rows, int num_cols)
{
   int i;

   for( i = 0; i &lt; num_rows * num_cols; i++)
      *(a + i) = -1;
}
</pre>
<p>Here we are using the generic variable name <em>a</em> which
is a pointer to an <em>int</em>. 
The loop control variable <em>i</em> is the offset into the array. 
The call to this function for <em>grades1</em> would be:</p>
<pre>    init_int_array( (int *)grades1, NUM_STUDENTS1, NUM_TESTS1);
</pre>
<p>Here we cast the pointer constant into a pointer to an integer,
which matches the declaration in the function. The constants for the
dimensions of the array are passed to <em>init_int_array()</em>
to be used for the calculation of the total number of elements 
in the array.</p>

<h3>Array Processing: Generalized Using a Function</h3>
<p>If all of the usable data is stored in the upper left corner of
the array, it is a relatively simple matter to access the appropriate elements.
The following call to <em>get_highest()</em> sends a casted pointer
to the array, the number of columns in the array, and the bounds
of the upper left corner where the data is.</p>
<pre>   high_test1 = 
      get_highest( (int *)grades1, NUM_TESTS1, num_students1, num_tests1);
</pre>
<p>The code for the function which follows illustrates the power
of pointers and offsets in the C language. 
While we may wish to view a list of items as
a number of sub-lists, the items are stored in the computer in
consecutive memory locations. We can use pointer arithmetic to
convert our two-dimensional perception of reality to the linear
view dictated by how RAM is utilized. The four arguments passed by
the function call above are sufficient for this purpose. 
</p><ol>
<li>The pointer constant <em>grades1</em> provides the array's 
starting point in RAM.
</li><li><em>NUM_TESTS1</em> provides the maximum number of possible 
items in the sub-list. 
</li><li><em>num_students1</em> provides the number of rows to be checked.
</li><li><em>num_tests1</em> provides the number of columns to be checked.
</li></ol>
<p>The following expression can be used to access an element of the array.</p>
<pre>  *(a + i*cols + j)
</pre>
<ol>
<li><em>a</em>, which remains constant, points at the zeroth element of the list.
</li><li><em>cols</em>, which remains constant, is the number of columns in a row. 
</li><li><em>i</em> ranges from 0 to one less than the number of rows to be searched.
</li><li><em>j</em> ranges from 0 to one less than the number of columns to be searched.
</li></ol>
<p>With <em>a</em> remaining constant, it can be seen that <em>i*cols + j</em>
provides the offset from the beginning of the list.</p>
<p>Here is a complete function which can be used to return the largest 
<em>int</em> in a portion of a two-dimensional array of any size.</p>
<pre>int get_highest(int *a, int cols, int row, int col)
/* Assumes that the elements with usable values are
   in the upper left corner of the array as 
   delimited by row and col;
   cols is the number of columns in the array passed */
{
   int i, j;
   int highest = *a;

   for( i = 0; i &lt; row; i++)
      for( j = 0; j &lt; col; j++)
         if ( *(a + i*cols + j) &gt; highest)
            highest = *(a + i*cols + j);
   return highest;
}
</pre>
<a name="program2"></a>
<h2>Sample Program 2</h2>
<p>This is a program which initializes parts of two arrays of integer
grades at the time of their declaration, each with 6 values. Then it
calls a function to find, return, and print the highest grade
in each of the two arrays.</p>
<pre>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

#define NUM_STUDENTS1 25
#define NUM_TESTS1 10
#define NUM_STUDENTS2 15

int main()
{
   int grades1[NUM_STUDENTS1][NUM_TESTS1] = { {55, 60, 65},
                                              {85, 90, 95} };
   int num_students1 = 2;
   int num_tests1 = 3;
   int high_test1;

   int grades2[NUM_STUDENTS2][NUM_TESTS2] = { {55, 60},
                                              {85, 90},
                                              {75, 70} };
   int num_students2 = 3;
   int num_tests2 = 2;
   int high_test2;
   
   high_test1 = 
      get_highest( (int *)grades1, NUM_TESTS1, num_students1, num_tests1);
   printf("The highest score in the first class is %d.\n", high_test1);

   high_test2 = 
      get_highest( (int *)grades2, NUM_TESTS2, num_students2, num_tests2);
   printf("The highest score in the second class is %d.\n", high_test2);

   return 0;
}

int get_highest(int *a, int cols, int row, int col)
/* Assumes that the elements with usable values are
   in the upper left corner of the array as

   cols is the number of columns in the array passed */
{
   int i, j;
   int highest = *a;

   for( i = 0; i &lt; row; i++)
      for( j = 0; j &lt; col; j++)
         if ( *(a + i*cols + j) &gt; highest)
